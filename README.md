# sqlite_in_rust

In this repo a module in rust was created to interact with sqlite3 database. The module is called `lib.rs` and it is located in the `src` folder. The module is used in the `main.rs` file to create a database and insert some data into it. The database is called `happiness.db` and it is located in the `project` folder. The `happiness.db` file is created if it does not exist. Three functions in the lib create the database and table; populate the table and; the third function connect with the database to do CRUD operations, this is a sample where you can query to insert, modify, delete or consult the database:
